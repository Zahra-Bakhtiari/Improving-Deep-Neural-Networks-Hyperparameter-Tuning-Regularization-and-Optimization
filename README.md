This repository includes below topics:

1) Initialization

Training your neural network requires specifying an initial value of the weights. A well-chosen initialization method helps the learning process.
In the [Initialization](https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks-Hyperparameter-Tuning-Regularization-and-Optimization/blob/main/Initialization.ipynb) notebook, I tried out a few different initializations, including random, zeros, and He initialization, and see how each leads to different results.

A well-chosen initialization can:

    a) Speed up the convergence of gradient descent
    b) Increase the odds of gradient descent converging to a lower training (and generalization) error
    c) Avoid vanishing/exploding gradients, which also slows down the optimization algorithm.
